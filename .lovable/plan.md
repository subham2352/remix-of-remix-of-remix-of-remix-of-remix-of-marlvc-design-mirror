# VC Accelerator Website — Inspired by MARL's Design

A multi-page venture capital / accelerator website with a modern, professional design using a dark navy, orange, and teal color palette similar to MARL's style. Placeholder branding will be used throughout so you can easily swap in your own brand later.
